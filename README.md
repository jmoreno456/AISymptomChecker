# AISymptomChecker
The purpose of this project was to create an ML model and a UI to predict diseases based on symptoms, In this project I used a dataset that a list of diseases from fungal infections, heart attacks, gerd and more. In the dataset, there was also a list of symptoms collected that was linked to the certain disease type. In building the ML model, I filtered out rows that only had one symptoms listed as this could have altered the results. I used atleast 3 symptoms per list. Then I vectorized the symptoms to binary using the MUltiLabelBinarizer() function from the sklearn.preprocessing library. I split the data into training/test sets with a 80/20 split. Then to train my model, I used a random forest model. After evaluating, the accuracy of my model from the sklearn.metrics library was a 0.97 through 984 tests.
To finish the UI, I added a list of the symptoms which allows the user to select any symptom present to describe their situation. I also added a user input bar if the symptom their expieriencing is not listed.
